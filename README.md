# Music-Store-Project
This project involves analysis of data of a music store using sql. In this project, we do fetch data from schema using sql querries.
We perform multiple tasks on database to fetch data for the analysis of music store data. In sql querries, we perform joins, common 
table expressions and multiple clauses such as select, from, where, group by, order by, limit, row_number(), etc.
